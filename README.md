📘 Project Title
Stock Price Prediction Using Sentiment and Technical Analysis

📝 Dissertation Summary (for README)
This project was developed as part of my MSc dissertation, focusing on building a machine learning model to predict stock prices by integrating two key approaches:

🔍 1. Technical Analysis
Extracted traditional stock market indicators such as:

Moving Averages (e.g., SMA, EMA)

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

MACD

Bollinger Bands

These features were used to capture historical price patterns and market momentum.

🗞️ 2. Sentiment Analysis
Collected financial news headlines and social media posts.

Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment scores:

Preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal)

Sentiment scoring using tools like VADER or pretrained sentiment models.

Merged sentiment scores with technical indicators to create a hybrid dataset.

🧠 3. Model Development
Used supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM).

Trained the model to predict:

Next-day opening and closing prices

Price trend (up/down classification)

📊 4. Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as:

MAE, RMSE for price prediction

Accuracy, Precision, and Recall for trend classification

⚙️ 5. Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Keras/TensorFlow)

NLP: NLTK, VADER

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
